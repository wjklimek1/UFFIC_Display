# UFFIC_Display
Ultra Fast Inter Integrated Circuit Display

UFIIC Display converts I2C serial data to HD44780 display commands. It can be powered from 3.3V or 5V power source. In case of using 3.3V power source internal step-up converter is used to boost voltage to 5V required to power HD44780 itself. Converter is based on cheap STM32F030F4P6 microcontroller that can be programmed and debuged via SWD interface.

Project is at early stage of development now, code for UFIIC and Arduino library will be provided in the future.
